Hey this is starting repos of ML with basic datasets<br>
Added Data Preprocess for the text and standard dataset set<br> 
Added The Regression Folder into the Repository<br>
From Today it will contain outputs with graphs<br>
# Data Preprocessing
 The subject matter in Machine Learning is Data preprocessing<br>
 It is said that 80% is data preprocessing from the 100% of data science.<br>
 So I introduce You two types of data preprocessing in numbers<br>
 - ### Categorical Variable
   There are mainly 2 types
    - Ordinal
    - Numeral
  #### Ordinal
   - They are the one's which can be compared or ordered<br>
     Say for example we can order grade A to grade B i.e.<br>
     Garde A > Grade B or say marks in grade A is > grade B.<br>
     They are handled by simply mapping ranking
 #### Nominal
  - This is the one's which can not be compared or at same level<br>
    best example gender we cannot compare gender<br>
    They are to be one hot encoded i.e. say male => [1, 0]<br>
    Female => [0, 1] as per this [Male, Female] is the data<br>
    <br>
